# Linux Desktop Theme Kit

üé® A portable Linux desktop setup that automatically changes your entire system theme based on your wallpaper! Works on any Linux distro with i3wm.

## What It Does

üñºÔ∏è **Smart Wallpaper Cycling** - Automatically extracts colors from your wallpapers  
üé® **Dynamic Theming** - Updates your entire desktop theme to match the wallpaper  
‚ö° **Fully Portable** - Works on any Linux distro (Ubuntu, Arch, Fedora, etc.)  
üéØ **One-Click Setup** - Everything installs automatically

**What gets themed:**
- i3 window manager (borders, gaps, workspace colors)
- Terminal (kitty with matching colors)  
- Status bar (i3blocks with color gradients)
- Notifications (dunst styling)
- Razer keyboard RGB (if you have one)

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Download and make executable
chmod +x *.sh

# 2. Run setup (detects your distro automatically)
./restore-configs.sh

# 3. Add your wallpapers to ~/Pictures/Wallpapers/

# 4. Restart i3 (Mod+Shift+R) or reboot
```

That's it! Press `Mod+Shift+W` to cycle wallpapers and watch your theme change.

## How It Works

**Includes configs for:**
- `i3` - Window manager with gaps and custom keybinds
